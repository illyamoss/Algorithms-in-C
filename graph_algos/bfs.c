/*

Breadth-First Search (BFS) - a fundamental algorithm used for traversing
or searching tree or graph data structures. The key of BFS is that it
explores all neighbors at the present depth level before moving on to
nodes at the next depth level.


Applications:
- Shortest Path: BFS can be used to find the shortest path in an
  unweighted graph.

- Level Order Traversal: In trees, BFS is used to print nodes level by
  level.

- Connectivity: Check if the graph is connected or find connected
  components.

- Cycle Detection: Detect cycles in an undirected graph.


Time Complexity:
- Space Complexity: O(V), V - number of vertices.
- Time Complexity: O(V + E), E - number of edges.
